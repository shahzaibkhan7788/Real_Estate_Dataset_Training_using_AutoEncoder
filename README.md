# Real_Estate_Dataset_Training_using_AutoEncoder
**Real Estate Price Prediction**
This project involves training a model on a real estate dataset with 7 continuous features and 424 samples to predict real estate prices. 
The dataset has been augmented to enhance generalization.
The project explores two regression techniques: a simple regression tree and an autoencoder combined with a regression tree.

**Techniques and Results
Simple Regression Tree
**
Achieved an R-squared value of 0.92.
Autoencoder with Regression Tree

Enhanced performance with an R-squared value of 0.97.
Used neural networks for autoencoding with normalization and augmentation.

Frameworks and Libraries Used
Keras: For building and training the autoencoder.
TensorFlow: Backend for Keras and additional neural network functionalities.
scikit-learn: For implementing the regression tree and evaluating model performance.

Dataset
Features: 7 continuous features.
Samples: 424 samples.
Augmentation: Applied to improve model generalization.
